  <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
  <p>Our website uses cookies to enhance your browsing experience and help us understand how our website is being used. Cookies are small text files placed on your device that enable us to recognize your browser and remember certain information.

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures include secure server technologies, encryption, and restricted access controls. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
